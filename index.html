   <div class="sky"><p>Sunny skies bring a sense of warmth, energy, and optimism that grey skies often lack. The brightness of the sun naturally boosts mood and motivation, making people feel more cheerful and productive. Outdoor activities become more enjoyable under a clear sky, encouraging physical exercise and social interaction. Sunny weather also provides essential vitamin D, which is beneficial for mental and physical health. In contrast, grey skies can feel heavy and dull, often associated with fatigue, gloom, or even sadness. While rainy days have their charm, the uplifting power of the sun makes sunny skies a favorite for many.
